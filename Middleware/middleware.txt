Middleware:  runs during the request/responsebcycle

- are just functions
- each has access to the request and response objects
- parsing body of form data or JSON data - parse the 
incoming request body and add it to the request object 
so that we can use it
- can end HTTP request by sending back a response with 
methods like res.send()
- OR it can be chained together, one after the another by 
calling next()
